# The Web is Fun Again

Remember when building for the web felt magical? When you could view source, learn from others, and ship something in an afternoon?

We went through a phase where web development became overly complex. Build tools, bundlers, transpilers, framework churn. It felt like you needed a PhD to ship a simple website.

## What Changed

Modern tools have finally caught up. They're fast, intuitive, and get out of your way.

- **Vite** - Dev servers that start instantly
- **Tailwind** - Styling without context switching
- **React Server Components** - The mental model we've been waiting for
- **Edge functions** - Deploy globally without thinking about infrastructure

## Back to Building

The best part? You can focus on what matters again. The tools fade into the background. You spend more time building features and less time fighting configuration.

This website is built with that philosophy. Modern stack, minimal complexity, maximum enjoyment.

```typescript
// It's this simple now
export default function Page() {
  return <div>Hello world</div>
}
```

The web is fun again. Let's build something.
