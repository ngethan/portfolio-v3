# Building in Public

There's something powerful about sharing your work before it's perfect.

I've always been the type to work in private, polishing every detail before showing anything to the world. But recently, I've started to shift that mindset. Building in public isn't about seeking validation or attention—it's about accountability, learning, and connection.

## Why Share the Process?

When you build in public, you get feedback early. You iterate faster. You connect with people who care about the same problems you're solving.

More importantly, you document your journey. Looking back at where you started gives you perspective on how far you've come.

## What I'm Learning

- **Ship imperfect work** - Done is better than perfect
- **Share the failures** - They're often more valuable than the wins
- **Build community** - The best projects are built with others, not for them

This website is part of that journey. It's not just a portfolio—it's a reflection of how I think about design, code, and building things that matter.
