# Thoughts on Design Systems

A design system is more than a component library. It's a shared language.

## The Problem

Most teams start building UI components and call it a design system. But without a clear philosophy, shared principles, and thoughtful constraints, you end up with a collection of parts that don't quite fit together.

## What Actually Matters

**Consistency over completeness**. It's better to have 10 well-designed, battle-tested components than 50 half-baked ones.

**Clear principles**. Every decision should trace back to a principle. "We use 8px spacing because..." not "We use 8px spacing because that's what we've always done."

**Real usage**. A design system isn't theoretical. If it's not being used in production, it's not a systemâ€”it's documentation.

## Building for Scale

The best design systems grow organically. Start small. Solve real problems. Document patterns as they emerge. Don't try to anticipate every use case upfront.

```tsx
// Good: Flexible and composable
<Button variant="primary" size="md">
  Click me
</Button>

// Bad: Too many specific variations
<PrimaryMediumButton>Click me</PrimaryMediumButton>
```

Design systems are about enabling your team to move faster while maintaining quality. If it's slowing you down, you're doing it wrong.
