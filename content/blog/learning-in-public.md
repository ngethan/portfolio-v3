# Learning in Public

The best way to learn is to teach. The best way to teach is to share your confusion.

I used to wait until I was an expert before writing about something. Now I write while I'm learning. It's uncomfortable, but it works.

## Why It Works

When you learn in public, you:
- Get feedback from people who know more
- Help people one step behind you
- Create a record of your thinking
- Force yourself to understand deeply

You can't explain something clearly if you don't understand it.

## The Fear

"What if I'm wrong? What if someone corrects me?"

Good. That's the point. Being corrected is how you learn faster.

The people who matter won't judge you for being wrong. They'll respect you for putting yourself out there.

## Start Small

You don't need to write a definitive guide. Share what you learned today. Explain a concept to your past self from yesterday.

Your perspective is valuable precisely because you're learning. Experts have forgotten what it's like to be a beginner.

```typescript
// Today I learned: You can use 'as const'
// to make TypeScript infer literal types

const colors = ['red', 'blue', 'green'] as const;
type Color = typeof colors[number]; // 'red' | 'blue' | 'green'
```

Share the small wins. They add up.
